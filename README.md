* Firefox [your first web extension](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension#Trying_it_out)

#### Continue local development

Once you have your local version of the extension built and installed how do we continue working as we update the extension?

1. `yarn watch` or `yarn build` works in most cases and automatically updates the extension.
2. Every once in a while you might need to refresh the extension using the refresh button.
